### **Infographic Presentation Layout: Tackling Plastic Pollution in Oceans**

#### **Title Section**
- **Main Title**: Tackling Plastic Pollution in Oceans
- **Subtitle**: An Innovative Approach with Algae-Based Plastic Degradation
- **Visuals**: Ocean background with plastic debris, sea creatures, and algae graphics.

#### **Section 1: The Problem**
- **Header**: The Problem
- **Bullet Points**:
  - **8 million tons** of plastic are dumped into oceans each year (Jambeck et al., 2015).
  - **5 trillion** pieces of plastic are floating in the world's oceans (Jambeck et al., 2015).
  - Plastic harms marine life, entangling sea creatures and disrupting ecosystems.
  - Microplastics are found in seafood and drinking water (Smith et al., 2020).
  - By **2050**, plastic could outweigh all fish in the ocean (World Economic Forum, 2023).
- **Visuals**: Icons or illustrations representing each bullet point, images of affected marine life, plastic debris.

#### **Section 2: Innovative Solution: Algae-Based Plastic Degradation**
- **Header**: Innovative Solution: Algae-Based Plastic Degradation
- **How It Works**:
  1. **Genetic Engineering**: Algae are genetically modified to produce plastic-degrading enzymes (Algal-based bioplastics, 2020).
  2. **Controlled Environments**: Cultivate algae in tanks or floating platforms.
  3. **Enzyme Secretion**: Algae break down plastic into smaller molecules (Algal-based Degradation of Microplastic, 2021).
  4. **Harvesting**: Regularly harvest algae to maintain balance.
- **Visuals**: Process flowchart with images/icons for each step.

#### **Section 3: Benefits**
- **Header**: Benefits
- **Bullet Points**:
  - **Eco-Friendly**: Uses natural organisms, no harmful chemicals.
  - **Scalable**: Can be adjusted for different pollution levels.
  - **Dual Purpose**: Algae also absorb CO2, reducing greenhouse gases (New Plastic Material, 2023).
  - **Economic Opportunities**: Creates jobs in biotechnology.
- **Visuals**: Icons or illustrations representing each benefit.

#### **Section 4: Challenges**
- **Header**: Challenges
- **Bullet Points**:
  - Requires significant research and development.
  - Must ensure it does not disrupt marine ecosystems.
  - Needs to navigate various regulatory approvals.
- **Visuals**: Icons representing research, ecosystem, and regulatory challenges.

#### **Section 5: Conclusion**
- **Header**: Conclusion
- **Text**:
  - **Algae-based plastic degradation** is a sustainable solution.
  - Combats plastic pollution and offers environmental and economic benefits.
  - Requires interdisciplinary collaboration, investment, and public awareness.
- **Visuals**: Summary graphics, images of clean oceans, collaborative efforts.
